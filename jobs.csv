Moving towards knowledge management and course support.<p>Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation&#x2F;process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We&#x27;re slowly scaling and expanding.<p>Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):<p>- FastAPI python backend
- MongoDB
- Langchain for the AI aspects, slowly moving away from it
- Next.js (react) frontend
- AWS<p>We have two open roles. Common requirements: excellent spoken English, a generalist&#x2F;&quot;get things done&quot; mentality (we&#x27;re a small startup), and sufficient drive&#x2F;curiosity to figure things out (and build them&#x2F;fix them) on your own - we don&#x27;t micromanage.<p>- Junior&#x2F;mid AI&#x2F;backend engineer: you&#x27;d start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface. This isn&#x27;t a purely ML position; for now lots of the work is SWE&#x2F;back-end dev. Projects on the roadmap: migrating away from Langchain, building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning&#x2F;distillation where relevant to reduce latency&#x2F;costs.<p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn&#x27;t have to be a masters&#x2F;formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience&#x2F;understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)<p>- Junior&#x2F;mid QA engineer (part time, can be negotiated). Two main aspects to this:
1. Improve and expand our back-end tests; in particular, add E2E and integration tests
2. Manual QA as part of our release cycle, which you will then slowly automate with browser automation tools (selenium).<p>Experience requirements: ~bachelor level in relevant field &amp; 1y+ of relevant QA experience OR ~3-4 years of highly relevant work experience.<p>Send e-mail at `luca @ learnwise . ai` with brief intro + CV :)"

I’ve helped us hire 8 of our amazing teammates, and – spoiler alert! – we’re hiring for three more full stack software engineers.<p>Why would you want to work at YC? Well, the short of it is that you’d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started – with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.<p>Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:<p>- Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years<p>- Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers<p>- Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies<p>YC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (12 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC’s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you’d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies. Many of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC.<p>Building software at YC isn’t for everyone – YC’s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners’ advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC’s ability to help more companies, and in a way that means <i>more</i> 1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.<p>If you have questions, I would love to answer them here.

Their work involves managing healthcare payments, directing patients to suitable care providers, and providing transparency in performance for hospitals and insurers in value-based care models.","Nuna (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuna.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuna.com</a>) | San Francisco &amp; Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer
In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.<p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
