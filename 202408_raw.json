By querying, aggregating and displaying relationships between sequencing datasets (and meta-data) and the viruses they contain, we hope to illuminate the hidden universe of viruses all around us.<p>Project Overview: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mPUM-adhXd8&amp;t=5875s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mPUM-adhXd8&amp;t=5875s</a><p>Project Paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-021-04332-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-021-04332-2</a><p>We&#x27;re seeking a talented and innovative designer to assist the team with designing a user-friendly, intuitive, and visually compelling web interface for this research project and help further biomedical discovery.

In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.<p>Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth&#x27;s geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial &quot;global thermostat&quot; to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.<p>On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the &quot;operating system&quot; for enhanced weathering at scale.

We help small e-commerce brands compete with fewer people and less money using our AI marketing assistant. Brand owners pilot our assistant which connects to everyday tools, crunches data, recommends smart growth ideas, and creates marketing content and campaigns. The result: they cover more marketing ground with less. Our brands grow on average by 53% over 5 months thanks to Needle&#x27;s ideas. We just launched and already have 100+ brands using us with revenue, traction, and even closed our biggest subscription to date at $2k&#x2F;month last week.<p>Why It’s Exciting<p>Join us at a thrilling stage - small enough to feel like a founding member of a startup, but with clear traction&#x2F;revenue and about to raise more from investors. We&#x27;re defining what “AI co-pilots” truly mean in marketing for small brands. This is a team that&#x27;s helped brands grow for 20+ years and had several exits before. Not random founders. Not a random problem. Not randomly playing around with &quot;gen ai.&quot; In fact, gen AI is only part of what we do.<p>Who Are We Looking For?<p>An entrepreneurial Lead AI Engineer to help us innovate and scale our asset generation across images, video, and HTML generation. Key skills: AI&#x2F;LLM models, generative technologies, React, and cloud platforms (GCP).

From typically enterprise-y stuff (financials software, HR software, AD, O365, Google, Zoom, etc.), to networking (building&#x2F;core switches, firewall, campus wifi, residential networking, circuits, VPN, DNS, IP mgmt.), to endpoints (desktop support, lab endpoint support, Jamf, mobile phones), to research (computing, storage, hosting, consulting), we provide a broad range of services to campus.<p>I have three positions to shout out here:<p>• The Information Security Office both acts as a policy-making body and a service provider.  ISO are looking for a Cloud Security Engineer.  This HYBRID or REMOTE position will engage with cloud users (including Faculty and Students with their own cloud presence), helping to keep their cloud installations secure.  You&#x27;ll handle security reviews, vulnerability reports, and incident response.  You&#x27;ll use tools like Wiz, Splunk, Qualys, CrowdStrike, and ProofPoint, plus a lot more.  For more information, check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDF81RNh\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDF81RNh</a><p>• Stanford University Networking is hiring a LAN Engineer.  Responsible for 178k network ports and 17k Wi-Fi access points, LAN-E handles new physical network designs (for new builds and renovations), and acts as 2nd-level support for questions coming from the Local Network Administrators that support their end-users.  LAN-E deals with Cisco &amp; Juniper (both for Wired and Wireless), Palo Alto firewalls, VXLAN&#x2F;EVPN, and WDM.  For more information, check out <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8JBRNg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8JBRNg</a><p>• Stanford University Networking is also hiring a CT Senior Network Engineer.  Communication Technology is the group responsible for voice comms across both the University and the Hospitals.  We are primarily a Cisco Unified Communications shop, but we deal also with Avaya.  Besides VoIP and analog service, you&#x27;ll work with Contact Center, call recording, E-911, and underlying technologies (SIP, BGP, etc.).<p>The two Networking positions are HYBRID positions. If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except in Menlo Park).<p>The ISO position can be HYBRID or REMOTE.  If Remote, expect to travel to either campus or our Redwood City offices a few times a year.<p>All three positions require participation in a 24x7 on-call rotation. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation).

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.<p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We&#x27;re growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We&#x27;re obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You&#x27;ll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you&#x27;ll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we&#x27;ve built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We&#x27;ve implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you&#x27;ll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you&#x27;ll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>We&#x27;re hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren&#x27;t singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you&#x27;ll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you&#x27;ll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we&#x27;ll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we&#x27;ll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.<p>--<p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We&#x27;re looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend&#x2F;backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.<p>Ideally you&#x27;ve already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you&#x27;re the right fit for the team we&#x27;ll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.<p>--<p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We&#x27;re hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning&#x2F;data science, data transformation&#x2F;ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We&#x27;ll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.<p>Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend&#x2F;backend web development, and data mining.<p>--<p>Ex-Founders (all roles) - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We encourage founders in software engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, design, and product to reach out. If you don&#x27;t see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com. We care more about the person than the job position, and we&#x27;re happy to craft the perfect position for anyone that joins our team. People with founder experience tend to be very successful at MixRank, and our leadership team is filled with founders.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m Scott, Founder&#x2F;CEO&#x2F;CTO.

For myself, I&#x27;m working on securing our recently announced AI features -- how do you deal with model security? Especially when some of those models include private data? How do you manage access to trained model artifacts across dev, staging, and production? Not a lot of prior art here, so lots of learning involved!<p>We&#x27;re really just looking for smart people that want to find problems to chip at.

We&#x27;re doing a lot of data plumbing right now building pipelines, hardening infrastructure, and data security. There is a research component here as well though--figuring out how to train novel models and understanding exploits, working with PhDs and reading papers, and skilling up what &quot;red teaming&quot; this space even looks like. I&#x27;m on this team.<p>#2: Platform Security. Figma uses AWS extensively and we&#x27;ve been working with other platform teams to harden this part of the stack. Some really smart people that I enjoy working with a lot and a portion of my time is spent on these problems too. (also includes hardening around employee laptops too)<p>#3: Product Security. (AppSec + Anti-Abuse) Figma uses a lot of Ruby, but increasingly Golang too. I joined this team initially and can answer any questions. The major efforts are around trying to harden the stack to make things &quot;Secure by Default&quot; and also decreasing complexity in areas like permissions which has grown pretty wild. (There are some blog posts on this if you&#x27;re curious)<p>Happy to chat through any of these. In general we&#x27;re looking for 8+ years of experience currently, though if you feel particularly excited and have a strong background for any of these please shoot me an email. :)",
