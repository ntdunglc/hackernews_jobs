We’re building a kinder, more helpful platform for independent artists to release their music and build a following. By providing artists with easy-to-understand tools and insights in a notoriously over-complicated industry, we want to empower DIY artists to control their careers without making concessions.<p>In the last years we’ve built the platform from the ground up and are now entering a phase where we’re focusing on growth and maturity. We’ve also secured funding for the next three to four years, so we can provide a stable job with great growth potential.<p>We are actively looking for a lead developer (with a hope you can transition into a CTO role in the near future) and a marketing manager. Unfortunately we can’t offer relocation or visa sponsorship and are only considering candidates that are able to join us in the office weekly.<p>Check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.makewaves.fm&#x2F;general&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.makewaves.fm&#x2F;general&#x2F;careers</a> for more details.",

We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.\nHealthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.<p>What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.<p>We’re changing that.<p>At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)<p>Our typical paid rate is above 95%.<p>We are a team of 25 with strong product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.<p>You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.<p>Interested in fixing American healthcare?

In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.<p>Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth&#x27;s geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial &quot;global thermostat&quot; to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.<p>On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the &quot;operating system&quot; for enhanced weathering at scale. There&#x27;s a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.<p>We are hiring for Senior-level roles in:<p>- Full-Stack Engineering<p>- Data Science<p>- Applied Statistics<p>If you have experience of any kind in farming, commercial agriculture, geospatial data &#x2F; GIS, farm management software, building tools for semi-technical power users (think Excel&#x2F;Airtable&#x2F;Google Earth), or working on offline applications, please mention this in your email - we&#x27;d love to hear about it!<p>You can reach out to us directly via hn [at] lithoscarbon.com",

Aim to relieve teachers and admin workers of tedious &quot;easy&quot; questions so they can focus on important cases. Moving towards knowledge management and course support.<p>Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation&#x2F;process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We&#x27;re slowly scaling and expanding.<p>Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):<p>- FastAPI python backend\n- MongoDB\n- Langchain for the AI aspects, slowly moving away from it\n- Next.js (react) frontend\n- AWS<p>We have two open roles. Common requirements: excellent spoken English, a generalist&#x2F;&quot;get things done&quot; mentality (we&#x27;re a small startup), and sufficient drive&#x2F;curiosity to figure things out (and build them&#x2F;fix them) on your own - we don&#x27;t micromanage.<p>- Junior&#x2F;mid AI&#x2F;backend engineer: you&#x27;d start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface.

Projects on the roadmap: migrating away from Langchain, building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning&#x2F;distillation where relevant to reduce latency&#x2F;costs.<p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn&#x27;t have to be a masters&#x2F;formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience&#x2F;understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)<p>- Junior&#x2F;mid QA engineer (part time, can be negotiated). Two main aspects to this:\n1. Improve and expand our back-end tests; in particular, add E2E and integration tests\n2. Manual QA as part of our release cycle, which you will then slowly automate with browser automation tools (selenium).<p>Experience requirements: ~bachelor level in relevant field &amp; 1y+ of relevant QA experience OR ~3-4 years of highly relevant work experience.<p>Send e-mail at `luca @ learnwise . ai` with brief intro + CV :)",

I’ve helped us hire 8 of our amazing teammates, and – spoiler alert! – we’re hiring for three more full stack software engineers.<p>Why would you want to work at YC? Well, the short of it is that you’d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started – with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.<p>Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:<p>- Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years<p>- Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers<p>- Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies<p>YC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (12 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC’s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you’d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies. Many of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC.<p>Building software at YC isn’t for everyone – YC’s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners’ advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC’s ability to help more companies, and in a way that means <i>more</i> 1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.<p>If you have questions, I would love to answer them here. (It would help me understand how I can make our role &amp; work more clear!) And if this resonates with you, shoot me an email with what you’d most be excited to work on (job descriptions below) – ryan@ycombinator.com<p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Bookface - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=00c6950f-341f-4924-a456-ea32c9d5601d\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=00c6950f-341f-...</a><p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Work at a Startup - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-4cc3-82fe-7cc3e4679652\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-...</a><p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Internal Tools - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=bbf8f36d-60bf-4168-b2b8-fac91bc4534c\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=bbf8f36d-60bf-...</a>",

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.<p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
