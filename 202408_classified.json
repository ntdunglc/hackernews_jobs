In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.<p>Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth&#x27;s geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial &quot;global thermostat&quot; to keep Earth habitable \u2014 but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.<p>On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the &quot;operating system&quot; for enhanced weathering at scale.

You&#x27;ll handle security reviews, vulnerability reports, and incident response.  You&#x27;ll use tools like Wiz, Splunk, Qualys, CrowdStrike, and ProofPoint, plus a lot more.

If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except in Menlo Park).<p>The ISO position can be HYBRID or REMOTE.

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.<p>We\u2019re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We&#x27;re growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it\u2019s something they love to do. We&#x27;re obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You&#x27;ll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you&#x27;ll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we&#x27;ve built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We&#x27;ve implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you&#x27;ll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets\u2014 at MixRank you&#x27;ll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>We&#x27;re hiring continuously for the positions below\u2014 they aren&#x27;t singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you&#x27;ll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you&#x27;ll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we&#x27;ll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we&#x27;ll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.<p>--<p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We&#x27;re looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend&#x2F;backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.<p>Ideally you&#x27;ve already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you&#x27;re the right fit for the team we&#x27;ll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.<p>--<p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time<p>We&#x27;re hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning&#x2F;data science, data transformation&#x2F;ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more.

For myself, I&#x27;m working on securing our recently announced AI features -- how do you deal with model security? Especially when some of those models include private data? How do you manage access to trained model artifacts across dev, staging, and production? Not a lot of prior art here, so lots of learning involved!<p>We&#x27;re really just looking for smart people that want to find problems to chip at. The company is growing fast and there is no shortage of work. (I wrapped up my YC startup to join the team!)<p>Generic job req is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;figma&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4214880004\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;figma&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4214880004</a><p>Feel free to email me at fwortley at &lt;name of company above&gt;.com<p>-----<p>More details for the specific roles we&#x27;re hiring for:<p>#1: AI Security (the team I&#x27;m on). We&#x27;re doing a lot of data plumbing right now building pipelines, hardening infrastructure, and data security. There is a research component here as well though--figuring out how to train novel models and understanding exploits, working with PhDs and reading papers, and skilling up what &quot;red teaming&quot; this space even looks like. I&#x27;m on this team.<p>#2: Platform Security. Figma uses AWS extensively and we&#x27;ve been working with other platform teams to harden this part of the stack. Some really smart people that I enjoy working with a lot and a portion of my time is spent on these problems too. (also includes hardening around employee laptops too)<p>#3: Product Security. (AppSec + Anti-Abuse) Figma uses a lot of Ruby, but increasingly Golang too. I joined this team initially and can answer any questions. The major efforts are around trying to harden the stack to make things &quot;Secure by Default&quot; and also decreasing complexity in areas like permissions which has grown pretty wild. (There are some blog posts on this if you&#x27;re curious)<p>Happy to chat through any of these. In general we&#x27;re looking for 8+ years of experience currently, though if you feel particularly excited and have a strong background for any of these please shoot me an email. :)",
