In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.<p>Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth&#x27;s geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial &quot;global thermostat&quot; to keep Earth habitable \u2014 but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.<p>On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the &quot;operating system&quot; for enhanced weathering at scale.

Projects on the roadmap: migrating away from Langchain, building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning&#x2F;distillation where relevant to reduce latency&#x2F;costs.<p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn&#x27;t have to be a masters&#x2F;formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience&#x2F;understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)<p>- Junior&#x2F;mid QA engineer (part time, can be negotiated). Two main aspects to this:\n1. Improve and expand our back-end tests; in particular, add E2E and integration tests\n2. Manual QA as part of our release cycle, which you will then slowly automate with browser automation tools (selenium).<p>Experience requirements: ~bachelor level in relevant field &amp; 1y+ of relevant QA experience OR ~3-4 years of highly relevant work experience.<p>Send e-mail at `luca @ learnwise . ai` with brief intro + CV :)",

I\u2019ve helped us hire 8 of our amazing teammates, and \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 we\u2019re hiring for three more full stack software engineers.<p>Why would you want to work at YC? Well, the short of it is that you\u2019d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started \u2013 with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You\u2019d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day \u2013 which might be helpful if you\u2019re interested in starting a company yourself.<p>Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:<p>- Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years<p>- Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers<p>- Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies<p>YC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (12 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC\u2019s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you\u2019d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies. Many of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC.<p>Building software at YC isn\u2019t for everyone \u2013 YC\u2019s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners\u2019 advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC\u2019s ability to help more companies, and in a way that means <i>more</i> 1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.<p>If you have questions, I would love to answer them here. (It would help me understand how I can make our role &amp; work more clear!) And if this resonates with you, shoot me an email with what you\u2019d most be excited to work on (job descriptions below) \u2013 ryan@ycombinator.com<p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Bookface - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=00c6950f-341f-4924-a456-ea32c9d5601d\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=00c6950f-341f-...</a><p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Work at a Startup - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-4cc3-82fe-7cc3e4679652\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-...</a><p>Y Combinator, Product Engineer on Internal Tools - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=bbf8f36d-60bf-4168-b2b8-fac91bc4534c\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;careers?ashby_jid=bbf8f36d-60bf-...</a>",

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.<p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
